# Healthcare workers that died from Coronavirus (COVID-19)
A R Shiny App to create an interactive website about healthcare worker deaths from COVID-19. A *.csv of data is included.  See: [https://jontheepi.shinyapps.io/hcwcoronavirus/](https://jontheepi.shinyapps.io/hcwcoronavirus/) for live website, data sources, and limitations.

## Structure
The R code contains a Map on the main page using Leaflet with tabs for additional graphs including time series, histograms, and bar charts.

## Data sources and limitations
From news reports. An underestimate. Mapped location is work/facility location. Unknown locations are placed at state capitol or nearest city.  In some cases, the source of transmission (work vs. community) may be unclear.
